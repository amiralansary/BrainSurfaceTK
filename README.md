MeshCNN is a general-purpose deep neural network for 3D triangular meshes, which can be used for tasks such as 3D shape classification or segmentation. 
This framework includes convolution, pooling and unpooling layers which are applied directly on the mesh edges.

We have made multiple modifcations, including functionality for regression, adding global features into the penultimate fully-connected layers, adding logging of test-ouput, and functionality for new learning-rate schedulers.
