gpu01 - same plateau run with resblocks
gpu08 - cyclic
gpu21 - classification

next
inflated run

static LR
LOOK AT BATCH SIZE 1 vs BATCH SIZE 2
instance normalisation

notes
seems like starting off at higher lr is better compare both ep30 runs (higher lr even at start?) - start at 0.005?
plateau might need to change threshold to 0.1, its %


CLASSIFICATION - might need to start off at a way higher LR
