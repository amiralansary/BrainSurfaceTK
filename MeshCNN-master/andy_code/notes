testfiles csv have format
{patient_id},{pred_class.item()},{label_class.item()},{correct.item()}

In straight testing mode, the files need to be in train! not in test
move all the train related testoutput files away first, they will be overwritten

inflated run

FOR LR RUNS, ADD KAIMING INIT? look at red50 ep30 run
LOOK AT BATCH SIZE 1 vs BATCH SIZE 2

lower LR linear = lambda
stepLR (might be too aggressive, so try with lower number of epochs in total but more often updates)
cyclic - check cylic is doing 5 epochs, not 5 batches
cosine

notes
seems like starting off at higher lr is better compare both ep30 runs (higher lr even at start?) - start at 0.005?
plateau might need to change threshold to 0.1, its %
might need to do 50 epochs instead of 30
