gpu01 - same plateau run with shuffle
gpu08 - classification with birthage as feature
gpu21 - classification

next
inflated run

instance normalisation
static LR
cyclic
LOOK AT BATCH SIZE 1 vs BATCH SIZE 2

notes
seems like starting off at higher lr is better compare both ep30 runs (higher lr even at start?) - start at 0.005?
plateau might need to change threshold to 0.1, its %
