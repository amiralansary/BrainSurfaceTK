48735 edges at red50

testfiles csv have format
{patient_id},{pred_class.item()},{label_class.item()},{correct.item()}

In straight testing mode, the files need to be in train! not in test
move all the train related testoutput files away first, they will be overwritten

inflated run
lower LR linear = lambda
stepLR (might be too aggressive, so try with lower number of epochs in total but more often updates)
ReduceLROnPlateau - need to implement val loss?
cyclic - check cylic is doing 5 epochs, not 5 batches
