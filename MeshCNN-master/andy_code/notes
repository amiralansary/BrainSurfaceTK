testfiles csv have format
{patient_id},{pred_class.item()},{label_class.item()},{correct.item()}

In straight testing mode, the files need to be in train! not in test
move all the train related testoutput files away first, they will be overwritten

LOOK AT BATCH SIZE 1 vs BATCH SIZE 2

notes
seems like starting off at higher lr is better compare both ep30 runs (higher lr even at start?) - start at 0.005?
plateau might need to change threshold to 0.1, its %

add resblocks again
