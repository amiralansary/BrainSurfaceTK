## Applying CNN to volumetric data

#### Instructions

These instructions are very similar to that in the other branches, so this should not take you a lot of time.

**First,** make sure you have a meta .tsv file containing information about your patients, using *comma separation convention*. This file should be placed in `models/volume3d/utils/` and should be strictly in the following format:

```
Index,  participant_id,   session_id,   gender,  birth_age,  birth_weight,  singleton,  scan_age,   scan_number,   radiology_score,   sedation,  exist
0,      CC00549XX22,      157600,       Female,  42.0,       3.685,         Single,     42.142,     1,             2,                 0.0,       1
```

**Second**, make sure to include a data split file, which must be a pickle file placed in `models/volume3d/utils/names.pk`. The pickle must contain a dictionary in the following format, 

```
{
'Train': ['CC00549XX22_157600', '{patient_id}_{session_id}', ... ],
'Val':   ['CC00590XX14_187000', '{patient_id}_{session_id}', ... ],
'Test':  ['CC00720XX11_211101', '{patient_id}_{session_id}', ... ]
}
```

**Third**, the file-naming convention is as follows:
```
sub-{patient_id}_ses-{session_id}_T2w_graymatter.nii.gz 
```


**Lastly**, add your volumetric `.nii.gz` data to any desirable destination with the name `gm_volume3d/`. Once this is done, you will need to change the global variable `PATH_TO_DATA` in `models/volume3d/utils/models.py`, such that `PATH_TO_DATA/` contains the folder `gm_volume3d/` with all the data.

Great! Now that everything is set up, you can configure any hyperparameters in `scripts/regression/VolumeCNN/run_volume3d_regression.py` and after setting up the virtual environment (refer to main-level README), call the following to run:

```
python3 -m scripts.regression.VolumeCNN.run_volume3d_regression
```
